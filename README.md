# Data-Structure-Algorithms-in-Python

This repository will have many data structures and algorithm implementation in python , simulation and some python templates.
Gradually , this repo will contain the solves from leetcode,Geekforgeeks,interviewbit as well.
It will also contain system design resources.

## Rules:

1. Anyone can provide any algorithm or data structure implementation.
   If you want to contribute,firstly you have to fork the repository.Work on that repository then send pull request.Please give a reference that which problem you solved ,which algorithm you implemented or what modifications you have done.

2. If you want a implementation or any kind help or any questions then you can write that in the issue section.

3. You can give suggestion in issue section to make the repository better.

4. You can provide program templates.Such as- Removing duplicates from a list or Counting frequency of numbers in list.
   Any modified template of algorithms will also be allowed. Such as - Finding Shortest Path using BFS/DFS , Find the node that is unreachable from the source using Dijkstra/BFS/DFS etc . So this kind of implementation will be allowed.

## Plans

- Solve 100 medium questions of big tech company problems and try to achive 45 min problem solving skill.
